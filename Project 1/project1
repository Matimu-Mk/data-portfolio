# 📊 Credit Risk & Loan Portfolio Analysis

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of a retail banking loan portfolio. Using **Power BI**, I transformed a raw dataset of 32,000+ records into an interactive dashboard to monitor default rates, interest rate sensitivity, and high-exposure lending risks.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Data Transformation:** Power Query (M Language) for ETL and Locale-based formatting.
* **Analysis:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures.
* **Visualization:** Power BI Desktop.
* **Environment:** VS Code for project documentation.

## 📈 Key Dashboard Features

### 1. KPI Scorecard
- **Total Principal Disbursed (R312.43M):** The total capital currently lent across the portfolio.
- **Portfolio Default Rate (21.82%):** The percentage of loans currently categorized as unpaid.
- **Weighted Avg. Interest Rate (11.01%):** The average cost of borrowing for the portfolio.

### 2. Risk Distribution Analysis
I implemented a **"Traffic Light" Risk Model** to categorize borrowers:
- **Low Risk:** High-grade loans with consistent payment history.
- **High Risk:** Loans showing signs of distress (Grades D-G).

### 3. High-Exposure Tracking
The dashboard includes a **Top 10 Exposure Table** which identifies the largest individual loans. This allows credit officers to prioritize intervention for high-value accounts at risk.

## 🏗️ Data Engineering Process
One of the primary challenges was **Data Cleaning**:
1. **Locale Conflicts:** Fixed interest rate decimal errors using English (US) locale settings in Power Query.
2. **Data Integrity:** Resolved "Sum of Accounts" errors by converting account fields to **Distinct Count** to accurately represent the 32,581 unique borrowers.
3. **Outlier Management:** Filtered and visualized interest rate spreads using Scatter Plots to identify predatory or high-risk outliers.
